Insurance version 1.0.0  is a free software which is developed by
Kian William Nowrouzian for Insurance Peace Co. 
It is a package including the component extension with its 5 plugins.
Check if plugins are enabled automatically or enable them yourself.
Also as you create a form a table is created with a name that corresponds with form's id.
On uninstall of the component these tables are to be dropped automatically, yet check again to be sure.
The extension is designed for insurance companies but you can employ it for
other purposes too, each form has its own url to be redirected to what you want.
The license is GNU/GPLv3.
